# Lab 5  
I added three configurations: Barista's experience, current season and current day. Barista's experience influences time for making a beverage and chance to fail any order. As more experienced Barista is as faster he does beverages and as rarely he makes mistakes. Season configuration logically accepts four values for every season and influences the chance cold or hot drinks will be ordered. Day influences the frequency of customers coming: at Monday, Sunday and Saturday frequency is increased, at Tuesday and Wednesday frequency is a bit more than usual and at Thursday and Friday frequency is usual. Every simulation hour (our minute) average Barista salary and all pure profit are shown.
